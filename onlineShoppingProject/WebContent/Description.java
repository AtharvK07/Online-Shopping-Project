/*The Java class `ConnectionProvider` is part of an online shopping project and serves the purpose of establishing a connection to a MySQL database. The class includes a single method, `getCon()`, which returns a `Connection` object to the calling code.

The method uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a MySQL database. It specifies the URL of the database (`jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ospjsp`), the username (`root`), and an empty password. It then loads the MySQL JDBC driver using `Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")` and establishes a connection using `DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)`.

If the connection is successful, the method returns the `Connection` object; otherwise, it catches any exceptions that might occur during the process and prints the error message, returning `null`.

This class can be utilized in the online shopping project to obtain a database connection whenever needed, facilitating interactions with the database for tasks such as retrieving product information, managing user accounts, and handling transactions within the online shopping platform. The connection details, such as the URL, username, and password, would typically be configured based on the specific database setup.*/
